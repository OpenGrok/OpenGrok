= How to build {OpenGrok =

The easiest way to build (or modify) {OpenGrok is by using any modern IDE, but you can also build {OpenGrok from the command line.

== Requirements ==

You need the following:

* [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp JDK] 1.8 or higher
* [https://maven.apache.org Maven]
* The source code is located in a [http://git-scm.com/ git] repository
* First build has to happen with mvn which downloads all dependencies

== Check out the source ==

The first thing you need to do is to check out the source code. You can check out the source with the following command:

 git clone https://github.com/oracle/OpenGrok

(or clone any of your forks)

== Open correct project ==

OpenGrok does have a maven pom.xml for its modules.

== Prepare the source for compilation ==

First build should download all needed dependencies, so don't get scared about missing jars.

== Compile the source ==

If you use NetBeans you should be able to open OpenGrok as a project and build it from there. Specifically, open pom.xml from the root directory, and click Run => Build Project (opengrok). (Ignore "Resolve problem" for jar files other than junit, but setup a webapp server for the -web-nbproject application.)

If you want to build from the command line, execute the following command (it will need internet connection first time, so setup any proxies if needed):

 mvn compile
